# Advent of Code 2019

This project follows the Advent of Code challenge, an advent calendar of programming puzzles released during the month of December. Each day has two related puzzles, the prompts for which can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019). Although these puzzles can be solved in any language, I chose to solve them using Ruby.
